# Periodic-Table
Graphical periodic table in written in C++ for TurboC it uses default Borland Graphics available in TurboC
Since it uses BGI(Borland Graphics Interface) do not expect it to run on modern day compilers. IT WILL ONLY RUN IN TURBOC3.
For running the program,mova all the files in BIN folder to BIN folder of you TURBOC3 and the files in INCLUDE folder to INCLUDE of your TURBOC3 compiler. 
Open TURBOC3 and open the MAIN.CPP file and run it.
